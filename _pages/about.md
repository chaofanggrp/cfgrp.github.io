Dr. Chao Fang joined the Sustainable Energy and Environment Thrust, Function Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as an Assistant Professor in January 2024. He obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from University of Science and Technology of China in 2015. In 2019, he completed his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech in the United States, followed by postdoctoral research at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. His research focuses on the theoretical and computational study of cross-scale transport mechanisms in soft energy matters, including electrolytes for energy storage and conversion, nanofluidic and interfacial transport, and polymer physics. Dr. Fang has published more than 20 papers as first or corresponding author in journals such as Nature Materials, Science Advances, Physical Review Letters, JACS Au, Chemical Science, and ACS Macro Letters. He serves as a Guest Editor for the journal Molecules (SCI Q2) and as referees for over ten SCI journals, including Nano Letters, Carbon, and Fuel. He has received awards such as the USTC Undergraduate Research Program Outstanding Award and the Pratt Fellowship from the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech.<!-- 这句话不会显示在网页上 -->
